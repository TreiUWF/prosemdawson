This model will help better understand how much rain can affect the ability to launch a rocket on its original launch window day. Methods This model will be created by a summation of data from the Kennedy Space Center weather page, Space Launch Delta 45, and JSR Launch Vehicle Database. When combined the resulting model of interest will be a Multinomial Logistic Spline Regression. Multinomial for the three distinct outcomes of interest:scrubbed,the launch did not happen on its scheduled day; delayed, the launch happened on its scheduled day but not in its original launch window; successful, launch in its original day in its original launch window. Then spline regression to look at how the probability changes at different ranges of rain amount. Results As the amount of rain increase the probability of a scrubbed launch increase in relationship to a successful or delayed launch. Conclusion In relation to a successful and delayed launch even without rain present the chances of a launch not scrubbing are not better than 40% and if there is any presents of rain then it can be assumed the launch will be scrubbed. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Statement of Problem 1.2 Relevance of Problem 1.3 Literature review", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Statement of Problem In this project, we will create a statistic to estimate how the amount of rain affects the likelihood of having a scrubbed in comparison to a successful or delayed launch from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A, Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, and Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41. Note that the undermost launches the launch weather criteria do not specifically state precipitation restrictions [1][2][3]. To gather the rain amount for this project we downloaded the historical data from the publicly available Spaceport Weather Archive website [4]. Some of the measured rain amount does seem questionable because of the unit of measurement provided is in inches rather than millimeters leading to a lose in accuracy due to the larger scale of an inch over millimeter. To find the launch records I got in touch with Space Launch Delta 45 public affairs. From there, the director of History and Heritage, Dr. Charles D. Dusch, was only able to get records of successful launches and not scrubbed or delayed. To get the last piece of information I turned to the JSR Launch Vehicle Database [5]. This website gave the need scrubbed launch information and with a combination of successful launch and scrubbed launch data we were able to make the delayed launch data. This was done by looking at the data and platform of each launch and if there was a successful and scrubbed launch with the same criteria it was conclude to be a delayed launch. 1.2 Relevance of Problem Anything to do with space is expensive, with a single launch ranging from 60 million to billions of dollars with delays costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. And a scrubbed launch can be just delayed to later that day to months depending on the required launch window.In high school, I participated in the Air Force Association StellarXplorers Nation Space Design Competition, this competition had group design and budget rocket launches with one of the challenges being estimating how much leftover budget should be left in the case of a scrubbed launch. The most common reason for a scrubbed launch is weather and have naturally wondered if it is possible to mitigate launch scrubs by the use of past weather data to save money. The scenarios used in the competition were real launch programs and thus the budgeting for launch scrubs is real and can cost hundreds of thousands to millions depending on the platform and delay. 1.3 Literature review With nearly 100 launches in the past 10 years, the Falcon 9 is one of the most commonly launched platforms from LC-39 and SLC-40. The platforms launch weather criteria include conditions relating to sustained wind, lightning, disturbed weather clouds, and field mill voltage but lack any direct specifications on precipitation[2]. A 2004 study in the pacific took a look at the relationship between wind speed and precipitation and concluded that there is a significant correlation between wind speed and precipitation [6]. As most Floridians know any light rain can quickly turn into a single-cell thunderstorm also known as popcorn that last as short time but hit the criteria need to scrub or delay a launch. Another study we looked at was a 1991 study Weather factors affecting rocket operations. This study looked at weather conditions on rockets at different altitudes and is significant here because whether it was wind, lightning, or turbulence a reoccurring factor in these conditions was rain and precipitation [7]. This is important because rain and precipitation is not necessarily part of the weather launch criteria. If we can link rain and precipitation with the weather conditions that are a part of the launch weather criteria, then it can be assumed if present then there be an increase scrubbed launch. "],["data-and-methods.html", "Chapter 2 Data and Methods 2.1 Data Description 2.2 Models and Assumptions 2.3 Analysis and Results", " Chapter 2 Data and Methods 2.1 Data Description Gathering data and data management was the most prevalent obstacle. Converting the data from its different formats to a usable sheet was a long and tedious procedure. The first data set collected was rain amount. This data was collected from the Space Weather Archive. The data set was the largest with over 3600 points across 10 years. It is important to note that there are clear misreadings in the data set and times with no data due to maintenance. These points did not seem to overlap many if any of the data points of interest. The second data set collected was the successful launch records. The data was provided by Space Launch Delta 45 out of the Patrick Space Force Base Public Affairs office. This data set includes successful launches from 2010-2020 with launches from land-based pads and sea vessels. This also means the inclusion of intercontinental ballistic missiles was in the data set. The data were filtered to exclude the years 2010 and 2020. Then any launch that was not at LC-39, SLC-40, and SLC-41 was also excluded. There were 193 data points of interest after the data was filtered. Map of Cape Canaveral Launch pads provided by reddit user u/TransitRanger_327 The last data set collected was scrubbed and/or delayed launch records. This was the hardest data set to collect. Delayed and scrubbed launches are not as well documented nor are talked about. Fortunately, there is a website created by Jonathan C. McDowell with the collaboration of many colleagues who have access to databases not easily attained by the public gave access to a comprehensive list of orbit and suborbital space launches. This data was originally collected to find trends of interest such as scrubbed launches on Friday the 13th and if the moon phase happened to add to the chance of scrubs. This data set may have a problem in accuracy but not in false data but missed data points because it has been run through in compared to other data banks to check for consistency. The problem is the data is compared in one direction for consistency and not missing data. Once successful, delayed, and scrubbed data was collected it was combined into one data set. For the purposes of this project, the launch categories are defined as follows: a successful launch is an on-time launch; a delayed launch is a launch that happened the same day as the scheduled on-time launch but was delayed for various reasons; a scrubbed launch is a launch that has been canceled or delayed past its original launch day. There were 193 points of interest. 117 points of delayed launches, 29 points of successful launches, and 47 points of scrubbed launches. The launch category is split into three numerical terms. A 0 indicates that the launch was scrubbed, a 1 indicates the launch was successful, and a 2 indicates the launch was delayed. Some keynotes with the collected data is that there is a data point at 1.9 in of rain which sits far from the other points, upon further research this is a legitimate point. Also for this study a successful launch being defined as launch in the original launch window there are cases of a successful launch where the rocket had a failure during flight, this is still considered a successful launch here. 2.2 Models and Assumptions 2.2.1 Logistic Regression The first thing we looked at was logistic regression with the outcomes of successful, scrubbed, and delayed launch. When making a logistic model we look at the probability of one event occurring in comparison to another event. For this study the base event was scrubbed launches and both models will be create simultaneously. \\[ \\begin{equation} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_j}{\\pi_c}\\right)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_1+...+\\beta_iX_i\\tag{1} \\end{equation} \\] where \\(j=1,...,c-1\\) and where \\(i = 1,..., k\\) and \\(k\\) is the number of predictors in the model \\(\\pi_j\\) is the event group \\(\\pi_c\\) is the reference group [8] 2.2.2 Spline Model Unlike a normal regression model that uses a constant slope to model the data we used a spline regression model to use different slopes at different ranges of indicators. This allowed us to better analyze the difference in probabilities at different ranges of rain amount. For this we created our knots, ranges, by splitting the data into quartiles. There are other ways to create knots but for this study and simplicity we decided to use quartiles. \\[ \\begin{equation} y= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1+...+\\beta_iX_i\\tag{2} \\end{equation} \\] \\[X_1 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if }x \\in (\\text{min},25^{th}) \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\] \\[X_2 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if }x \\in (25^{th},50^{th}) \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\] \\[X_3 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if }x \\in (50^{th},75^{th}) \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\] \\[X_4 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if }x \\in (75^{th},\\text{max}) \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\] [9] 2.2.3 Multinomial Logistic Spline Regression With a combination of the multinomail and spline regression we get our model of interest for this study. Note that when we make the models for this study that they are made simultaneously with scrubbed being the reference and use the same quartile for our knots. \\[ \\begin{equation} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_j}{\\pi_c}\\right)= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1+ \\beta_2X_2+ \\beta_3X_3+\\beta_4X_4\\tag{3} \\end{equation} \\] where \\(j=1,...,c-1\\) and where \\(i = 1,..., k\\) and \\(k\\) is the number of predictors in the model \\(\\pi_j\\) is the event group \\(\\pi_c\\) is the reference group \\(X_i\\) are the predictors \\(\\beta_0\\) is the regression intercept \\(\\beta_i\\) is the slope of predictor \\(i\\) 2.3 Analysis and Results Figure 2.1 Data of Study Figure 2.2 Distribution of Rain amount From Figure 2.1 you can see there is a lot of data points at the zero rain amount. To investigate this we created a histogram, Figure 2.2, to look at the distribution of rain amount and concluded there is clearly a lot more zeros in this data set that will be usable to create our knots. When first creating a five number summary with the zeros in the data the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile were all zeros. With these knots the model essential became a regression model with one slope. Due to this we decided to remove the zeros when assessing the quartiles. The majority of these launches were related to the Falcon 9 launch which is not surprising given the goal of this rocket. The CEO of SpaceX, Elon Musk, has goal with this rocket of being able to launch multiple times a day and currently they are on a very rapid schedule with a record rocket turn around time record of 27 days and record of 16 hours for launching two different rockets [10]. This adds plenty opportunities for scrubbed and delayed launches to stack up on no rain days adding to the excessive no rain data points. With the elimination of the zeros the new quartiles used were 0.019, 0.064, and 0.175 respectfully. The spline models created for this example have been made with with the reference point of scrubbed launches. \\[X_1 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{ if rain }x \\in (0, 0.019) \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\] \\[X_2 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{ if rain }x \\in (0.020, 0.064) \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\] \\[X_3 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{ if rain }x \\in (0.065, 0.175) \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\] \\[X_4 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{ if rain }x \\in (0.175, 1.90) \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\] \\[ \\begin{equation} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}_{\\text{scrub}}}{\\hat{\\pi}_{\\text{launch}}}\\right)=0.53+3.00X_1-8.58X_2+12.44X_3+36.59X_4\\tag{4} \\end{equation} \\] Model 2.1 Model 2.1 is looking at the probability of scrubbed versus launched given the rain amount. Figure 2.3 Probability of Launch versus Scrubbed In Figure 2.3 the vertical dotted lines represent the different knots in the model. The first vertical line represents the knot at 0.019; the second vertical line represents 0.064; the third vertical line represents 0.175. From figure 2.3 we can see an interesting occurrence where the the chance of a scrubbed launch decrease from 0.019 inches to 0.064 inches of rain. There does not seem to be a responsible explanation for this other than just a lack of data between the points. Even with this sharp increase in the visual model, the chances of a successful launch with an presence of rain is still less than 50% with anything greater than 0.175 inches practically 0%.

Figure 2.4 In figure 2.4 the vertical dotted lines represent the different knots in the model. The first vertical line represents the knot at 0.019 inches; the second vertical line represents 0.064 inches; the third vertical line represents 0.175 inches. From figure 2.4 we can see the same interesting occurrence from figure 2.3 where there is an decrease probability from 0.019 inches to 0.064 inches of rain. Again there is no practical explanation of this phenomenon. This model does show that with light rain there is still a considerable chance that the rocket will launch that day, just of course delayed. Looking back at the ambitious goal of some of the rockets being launched makes sense because a goal is to prove the ability to do consistent launches. The likelihood of a scrubbed launch is significantly increase passed the 0.175 in mark, reminding us regardless of how much a company wants to launch, there are still limitations.

"],["conclusion-1.html", "Chapter 3 Conclusion 3.1 Summary of Key Findings 3.2 Limitations 3.3 Suggestions for Further Study", " Chapter 3 Conclusion 3.1 Summary of Key Findings In conclusion, as the amount of rain increases the probability of a launch or a delayed launch decreases. This result is not surprising because of the the cost of a rocket launch, the insurance policies, and maintaining of a clean launch history for the rockets calls for heavy caution when it comes to a launch date. One thing to keep in mind is the amount of data with no rain but had scrubbed, delayed, and launch outcome overlapping that had to be removed making it hard to see what happens when there is a lack of rain. 3.2 Limitations Data collection was the biggest limitation that occurred in this process. There lacks to be an obtainable official collection of scrub launch data; nonetheless, data pulled from a public project to accomplish similar statistics was used. Due to the original constraint of lack of being able to find scrubbed/delayed data we only requested 10 years of successful launch data but now with the JSR data we could feel confident in asking the historian for their time in collecting 50 years of data. This model is limited with only having one predictor that as shown by the data cannot always reflect what is going on when for example, there is a mechanical problem and thus probably skewed in the lower rain amount ranges. Finally this model just assumes that all rockets have the same launch criteria, which they do not, manned versus unmanned missions get slightly different treatment in regards to weather conditions and if a delayed launch is even possible. 3.3 Suggestions for Further Study To further this project, we suggest adding more independent weather variables along with an increase in the timeline and decrease rocket types. This project was able to show that given rain the chances of a success launch drops significantly, to be able to show any change we had to get rid of a lot of data points with no rain but had different launch results. Adding my variables maybe able to show what happened during those events to make the data distinguishable enough to use. Secondly, increasing the time frame of the data will include more data then from this there can be enough data to look at a specific rocket type. Since different rockets may have a slightly different launch weather criteria, especially manned versus unmanned missions, the model will be able to more accurately tell if a specific platform will be more or less affected.
