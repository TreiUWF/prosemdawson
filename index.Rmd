## Objectives  {-}
'`

To model a scrubbed rocket launch in reference to a successful or delayed launched from Kennedy Space Center; specifically Launch Complex 39A (LC-39), Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40), and Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) and given rain amounts. This model will help better understand how much rain can affect the ability to launch a rocket on its original launch window day.

## Methods  {-}
'`

This statistic will be created by a summation of data from the Kennedy Space Center weather page, Space Launch Delta 45, and JSR Launch Vehicle Database. When combined the resulting model of interest will be a Multinomial Logistic Spline Regression. Multinomial for the three distinct outcomes of interest:scrubbed,the launch did not happen on its scheduled day; delayed, the launch happened on its scheduled day but not in its original launch window; successful, launch in its original day in its original launch window. Then spline regression to look at how the probability changes at different ranges of rain amount.

'`

As the amount of rain increase the probability of a scrubbed launch increase in relationship to a successful or delayed launch.

## Conclusion  {-}
'`

In relation to a successful and delayed launch even without rain present the chances of a launch not scrubbing are not better than 40% and if there is any presents of rain then it can be assumed the launch will be scrubbed.
